# Musical Chord Progression Arpeggiator

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/jak_e/pen/qNrZyw](https://codepen.io/jak_e/pen/qNrZyw).

A quick way to sketch out musical chord progressions.

uses my [Scale Generator](http://codepen.io/jakealbaugh/pen/NrdEYL/) and [Arpeggio Pattern Generator](http://codepen.io/jakealbaugh/pen/PzpzEO/) and the lovely [Tone.js](https://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js).

I've started collecting my musical composition stuff in [this collection](http://codepen.io/collection/DBMpBQ/).

I also made a few videos as an intro to using Tone.js on CodePen and put them on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uXDdTyYBYQ&list=PLTujTdKucISz9rx7gGqei3fAGrtA97uY0).
